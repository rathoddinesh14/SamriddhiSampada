# SamriddhiSampada

"SamriddhiSampada" is a combination of two Sanskrit words: "Samriddhi" and "Sampada".

- "Samriddhi" means prosperity, growth, and abundance.
- "Sampada" means wealth, treasure, and valuable assets.

When combined, "SamriddhiSampada" reflects the idea of creating a repository or platform that leads to the growth, abundance, and accumulation of valuable knowledge and resources in the realm of <b>full stack application development</b>. Just as wealth and prosperity are accumulated over time, this name suggests the accumulation of valuable information and skills in the context of creating and developing full stack applications.
